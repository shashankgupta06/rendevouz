a simple rendevouz problem 

Problem:

12 robots start moving around a ring their direction depending on a random fair coin toss. When two robots meet, they merge and together flip a fair coin that picks new direction. When a robot takes one lap around a ring without encountering another robot, it yet again flips a fair coin and picks new direction till eventually one is left. The code needs a few tweaks to function as desired, this will be fixed as soon as i find he time to!.
